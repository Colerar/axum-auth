# Axum Auth

High-level [http auth](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Authentication) extractors for [axum](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum)

## Usage

Bearer Authentication:

```rust
use axum_auth::AuthBearer;
 
/// Handler for a typical axum route, takes a `token` and returns it
async fn handler(AuthBearer(token): AuthBearer) -> String {
    format!("Found a bearer token: {}", token)
}
```

Basic Authentication:

```rust
use axum_auth::AuthBasic;
 
/// Handler for a typical axum route, takes a `token` and returns it
async fn handler(AuthBasic((id, password)): AuthBasic) -> String {
    if let Some(password) = password {
        format!("User '{}' with password '{}'", id, password)
    } else {
        format!("User '{}' without password", id)
    }
}
```
